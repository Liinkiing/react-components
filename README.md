## This is just a playground for myself
In this repository, you will find various components made by myself.
I wanted to learn React, so I decided to create various components (like a tab component for example).

The code may not be the cleanest code you will find, but I try to do my best to follow React's best practices,
but learning React is a bit different (all the declarative side, immutable states, pure functions etc...)
